## What is Ghost / How to Play

Ghost is a word game where players incrementally add letters to a dictionary word, while avoiding saying the last letter

The rules are a bit confusing, so here is a quick demo on how you play: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5FfWGXGQ30&ab_channel=AkhilKammila

You can play vs. the computer bots, or play online multiplayer with friends!

## What I accomplished:

The first implementation of the popular word game ghost

Built a functional singleplayer mode by calling DataMuse API to validate word existence

Designed easy, medium, and hard singleplayer bots by filtering dictionary words by the parity of their lengths

Built a multiplayer mode with private rooms by using web sockets to transmit user input in real time

Deployed the backend to AWS Elastic Beanstalk for live and scalable multiplayer functionality
